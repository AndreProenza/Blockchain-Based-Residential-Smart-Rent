# Blockchain-Based-Residential-Smart-Rent
The main solution to be developed specifies a tokenization model, allowing for users to self-manage a representation of their properties on the ledger for diverse purposes.   This representation is often referred to as Digital Twin. Our platform will provide Digital Twin-based services anchored in a DLT which will further promote flexibility to manage real estate.   One of the use cases is allowing partitioning the ownership of a property (smart rent), where the owner of real estate can sell or rent parts of it to one or more clients.  This activity includes designing the model for Digital Twins, implementing the smart rent as a smart contract, and providing the end-user tools to manage their properties.  The student will work on a decentralised ledger that aims to solve some of the above problems.
