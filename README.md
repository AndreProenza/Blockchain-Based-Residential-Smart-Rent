## Introduction

<details>
  <summary><b>&nbsp;Show&nbsp;more</b></summary>
<div>

<h6>
The real estate market is fragmented and real estate mediation processes are considered extremely complex, inefficient, and opaque. This complexity and lack of transparency results from the current process of buying and selling a property, involving a large number of actors with different responsibilities and objectives, which often leads to a conflict of interest, resulting in a lack of trust between the parties. The current solution to this problem is the use of intermediaries such as banks, real estate agencies, notaries and law firms. 
</h6>

<h6>
However, this intermediation makes the process slower and more expensive due to the process and communication inefficiencies. 
Blockchain technology helps to solve the intermediation problems and in the verification and traceability of multistep transactions needing verification and traceability.

<h6>
It can provide secure transactions, reduce compliance costs, and speed up data transfer processing. 
Companies and governments alike are now investing heavily in DLT technology to offer better services and products to people.

## Abstract

<details>
  <summary><b>&nbsp;Show more</b></summary>
<div>

<h6>
The real estate market includes complex and inefficient mediation processes. Renting a property envolves multiple entities with different responsibilities and interests. Therefore it is imperative to establish a trustful relationship between parties through intermediaries such as notaries, banks or real estate
agencies to avoid eventual disputes. Although an intermediary ensures trust, the current process still has some drawbacks concerning efficiency, costs, transparency, bureaucracy and data security. The blockchain technology aims to reduce this issues by providing transparent and secure real estate transactions. We propose a GDPR compliant blockchain-based residential smart rental platform, designed to allow both landlords and tenants to establish rental contracts and make rental payments securely.
